The profiles provide measures on a broad range of topics including: population, diversity, disadvantage and social engagement, housing, transport and education, health status and service utilisation, child and family characteristics and service utilisation. Rankings are provided to enable comparison of LGAs, along with the Victorian averages. The profiles are structured to provide a measure on each variable for each Local Government Area (LGA), and to also enable comparisons by providing rankings against all Local Government Areas as well as the Victorian measure. Profiles are also provided for former Department of Health regions, as well as the former Department of Human Services operational service areas and divisions. Note that all data is the most current available at the time of publication. Based on the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS), Non ABS Structures, 2015 (note, according to the ABS website LGA boundaries have not changed since 2014).","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"lga_code","type":"Integer","title":"LGA Code (2015)","description":"Local government area (LGA) code.","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"lga_name","type":"String","title":"LGA Name (2015)","description":"Local government area (LGA) name.","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"index_of_relative_socio_economic_disadv_irsd","type":"Double","title":"Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage score (2011)","description":"The Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD) is a measure of the relative socio-economic disadvantage in a given geographic area. The ABS uses Census data to develop the IRSD. It is derived from range of Census variables considered to reflect levels of disadvantage, including income level, employment status and level of educational attainment. IRSD scores are standardised across ABS Statistical Area 1s (SA1) so the average IRSD score across Australia is 1000. Scores for larger areas such as LGA are derived by calculating a population-weighted average of the component SA1s. Scores lower than 1000 indicate relatively disadvantaged areas - the lower the score, the greater the level of relative disadvantage. These scores are revised every five years, after each Census of Population and Housing.
