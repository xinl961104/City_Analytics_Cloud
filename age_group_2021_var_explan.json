The data is presented in 2011 Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries and covers each fifth year for the years 2011 to 2031.<br/><br/>\n\nThe Victoria in Future series is a projection of the ERP for LGAs and Victoria in Future Small Areas (VIFSA) for 2011 to 2031. Some data areas are available for individual years and some for every fifth year in the projection period. The first year for each dataset within the series is 2011. Where available, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data is used for the years 2012 to 2015.<br/><br/>\n\nData are available for Estimated Resident Population (ERP - the official total population), population by age and sex (for single years of age in some cases, otherwise for five-year age groups), households and dwellings (including average household sizes and dwelling occupancy rates).<br/><br/>\n\nVictoria in Future 2016 population projections are not predictions of the future, nor are they targets. They analyse changing economic and social structures and other drivers of demographic trends to indicate possible future populations if the present identified demographic and social trends continue. Projections are based exclusively on demographic components at the state and regional level, while local level projections take account of current and future land use, dwelling capacity, and development opportunities in addition to local demographic factors.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more information please visit the <a href=\"https://www.planning.vic.gov.au/land-use-and-population-research/victoria-in-future-2016/victoria-in-future-data-tables\" target=\"_blank\">DELWP VIF Portal</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nNotes: \n<ul>\n<li>AURIN has spatially enabled the original data.</li>\n<li>These detailed projections replace the projections published in Victoria in Future 2015 (based on the 2011 Census) issued by the Department of Transport, Planning and Local Infrastructure (DTPLI).</li>\n<li>The base year for the calculation of VIF2016 projections is 2015 (as at 30 June), the most recent year for which the ABS has published the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for both Victoria and for LGAs.</li>\n<li>The data tables have been condensed to one dataset to allow longitudinal analysis of the data through year-period filters.</li>\n</ul>","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"year","type":"String","title":"Year","description":"Year","stype":"nominal","categories":[{"key":"2011","label":"2011"},{"key":"2016","label":"2016"},{"key":"2021","label":"2021"},{"key":"2026","label":"2026"},{"key":"2031","label":"2031"}],"filterValue":"2021","isDimension":true},{"name":"lga_code","type":"String","title":"LGA Code 2011","description":"LGA Code 2011.","isDimension":false},{"name":"lga_name","type":"String","title":"LGA Name 2011","description":"LGA Name 2011.","isDimension":false},{"name":"p0_4","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 0-4","description":"Persons aged 0-4.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"p5_9","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 5-9","description":"Persons aged 5-9.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"p10_14","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 10-14","description":"Persons aged 10-14.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"p15_19","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 15-19","description":"Persons aged 15-19.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"p20_24","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 20-24","description":"Persons aged 20-24.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"p25_29","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 25-29","description":"Persons aged 25-29.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"p30_34","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 30-34","description":"Persons aged 30-34.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"p35_39","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 35-39","description":"Persons aged 35-39.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"p40_44","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 40-44","description":"Persons aged 40-44.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"p45_49","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 45-49","description":"Persons aged 45-49.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"p50_54","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 50-54","description":"Persons aged 50-54.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"p55_59","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 55-59","description":"Persons aged 55-59.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"p60_64","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 60-64","description":"Persons aged 60-64.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"p65_69","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 65-69","description":"Persons aged 65-69.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"p70_74","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 70-74","description":"Persons aged 70-74.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"p75_79","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 75-79","description":"Persons aged 75-79.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"p80_84","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 80-84","description":"Persons aged 80-84.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"p85_ov","type":"Integer","title":"Persons aged 85 And Over","description":"Persons aged 85 And Over.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","where":"(year IN ('2021'))","feature":{"key":"lga_code","geoLevel":"lga2011","geoField":"ignored","year":"2006","featureBbox":[140.961681984,-39.159189527500004,149.976679008,-33.9806475865],"featureType":"ste","featureInstance":"2","featureName":"Victoria","referenceSystemIdentifier":"urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:4283","prefix":"","keyTransform":null},"states":["2"]}}
