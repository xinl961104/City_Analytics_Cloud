This data is based on the 2006 census and follows the 2006 Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) boundaries.\n<br/><br/>\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has developed indexes to allow ranking of regions/areas, providing a method of determining the level of social and economic wellbeing in that region. There are four indexes included in the SEIFA 2006 product. They relate to socio-economic aspects of geographic areas. Each index summarises a different aspect of the socio-economic conditions in an area. The indexes have been obtained by a technique called principal components analysis. This technique summarises the information from a variety of social and economic variables, calculating weights that will give the best summary for the underlying variables. For the SEIFA indexes, each index uses a different set of underlying variables.<br/><br/>\n\nAll the indexes (including the Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage) have been constructed so that relatively disadvantaged areas (e.g. areas with many low income earners) have low index values.<br/><br/>\n\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 2033.0.55.001) used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. <br/><br/>\n\nFor more information on this data please visit the <a href='http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/allprimarymainfeatures/356A4186CCDDC4D1CA257B3B001AC22C?opendocument' target='_blank'>Australian Bureau of Statistics<a/>.<br/><br/>\n\nPlease note: \n<ul>\n<li>AURIN has spatially enabled the original data following the <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1216.0Main+Features1Jul%202006?OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\">2006 ASGC</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"lga_code_2006_","type":"String","title":"LGA Code","description":"lga_code_2006_","isDimension":false},{"name":"lga_name_2006_","type":"String","title":"LGA Name","description":"lga_name_2006_","isDimension":false},{"name":"irsd_score","type":"Integer","title":"IRSD Score","description":"irsd_score","isDimension":false},{"name":"ranking_within_state_or_territory_rank_","type":"Integer","title":"Ranking Within State of Territory (Rank)","description":"ranking_within_state_or_territory_rank_","isDimension":false},{"name":"ranking_within_state_or_territory_state_","type":"String","title":"State","description":"ranking_within_state_or_territory_state_","isDimension":false},{"name":"urp","type":"Integer","title":"Usual Resident Population","description":"urp","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","feature":{"key":"lga_code_2006_","geoLevel":"lga","geoField":"ignored","year":"2006","featureBbox":[140.961681984,-39.159189527500004,149.976679008,-33.9806475865],"featureType":"ste","featureInstance":"2","featureName":"Victoria","referenceSystemIdentifier":"urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:4283","prefix":"","keyTransform":null},"states":["2"]}}
